# Bridge Crossing Problem

## Overview
The bridge-crossing problem involves four persons (A, B, C, and D) who want to cross a bridge at night. Each person has a different crossing time:
- A: 1 minute
- B: 2 minutes
- C: 5 minutes
- D: 8 minutes

The following constraints apply:
- Only two persons can be on the bridge at any time.
- They must move at the pace of the slower person.
- There's only one torch.

The goal is to get all four persons across the bridge in 15 minutes or less.

## Solution
We've implemented a Python solution that follows this strategy:
1. A and B cross together (2 minutes).
2. A returns with the torch (1 minute).
3. C and D cross together (8 minutes).
4. B returns with the torch (2 minutes).
5. A and B cross again (2 minutes).

The total time elapsed is 15 minutes, and the order of crossings is:
1. A and B
2. A returns
3. C and D
4. B returns
5. A and B
